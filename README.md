# Boilerplate C Project

Boilerplate C code master branch is empty template. 
- cmake
- .c sources in /src
- .h in /include

Other versions will be added into different branches of this repo. I am currently learning cmake so this will be done as and when I get around to it. 

## Building

- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`

Application will be built and placed into the build directory.
